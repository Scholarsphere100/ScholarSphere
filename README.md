# ScholarSphere
Shared repository for final year Software Design projects\
This is our project and we have decided not to use any framework( No Vue, React nor Angular) only html, css and javascript

In our project there is no need to build as this is a Static Web App
to use the app you must go to your terminal and type
git clone https://github.com/Scholarsphere100/ScholarSphere.git
then
cd ScholarSphere

and like that you have cloned the repository 
In vs code you may download the live server extension or any other similar way
Open the index.html to start at the landing page  

That is all
