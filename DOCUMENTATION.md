## üß™ Testing Approach (TDD)

The team follows a **Test-Driven Development** methodology. This means writing unit/integration test cases before implementing features.

**Testing Tools:**
- `Jest` for unit and functional tests
- `Supertest` for API endpoint testing  // To  be edited as time goes on

Each user story has defined test cases written before implementation to validate:
- Authentication and role restrictions
- Proper API request/response structure
- Database side effects (user creation, status updates, etc.)
